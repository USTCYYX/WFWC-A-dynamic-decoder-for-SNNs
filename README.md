# WFWC decoder
This is the open-source repository of the paper: A dynamic decoder with speculative termination for low latency inference in spiking neural networks. If you want to test WFWC decoder on a directly trained SNN, please use the WFWC_SLTT folder; if you want to test WFWC decoder on an SNN obtained through ANN-to-SNN conversion, please use the WFWC_QCFS folder.
